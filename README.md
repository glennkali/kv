Distributed Key Value store with automatic backup strategy.

The project leverages Elixir's primitives for concurrency and partitioning.

The umbrella project contains 2 apps KV and KV-Server that can be deployed and scaled independently.


The KV-server implementation handles load balancing automatically.
